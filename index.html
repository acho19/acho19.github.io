      <p>I would definitely call myself a certified dog mom. In my list of priorities in terms of interests and hobbies, <a href = "minniec.html">Minnie</a>, my dog, definitely comes first. Her safety and well-being is number one to me. I can't stop talking about her so excuse my constant talking. Besides Minnie, one of my hobbies is <a href = "baking.html">baking</a>. My special baked good is Japanese Cheesecake. Another one of my hobbies is <a href = "cooking.html">cooking</a>. I specialize in cooking Korean food and I love cooking Korean food for my friends. My hobbies are also included on the top of the page but it is not as important as Minnie's page.</p>
